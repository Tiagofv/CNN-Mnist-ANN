# Architecture
To solve this problem we've used the following architecture:
- Pytorch
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Adam optimizer
- 

# Results
With 10 epochs, we've achieved 98% precision on the test dataset.

After every epoch, we test the trained model on the test dataset. The model is saved after the last epoch.![confusion_matrix.png](confusion_matrix.png)
